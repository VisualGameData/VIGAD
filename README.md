# Vigad

## Description

Welcome aboard fellow developers, this is an application where you are able to capture areas on your screen and search for a specific value inside of it. With the generated data, there are endless possibilities to use it for, as well as endless use cases for the application.

## Requirements

You need to have Node.js installed on your system.

## How to Install and Run the Project

Currently, we do not have a release ready version of Vigad, but if you are interested to see what is happening, you can install in locally onto your system.

Foremost, you need to clone our repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VisualGameData/VIGAD.git
```

Afterwards, you need to install the packages.

```sh
npm i
```

Then there are two possibilities, you can either start the application in developer mode via.

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or if you would like to properly install the application as a program onto your system, you can write

```sh
npm run build
```

and then execute the generated executable file (Windows) and you should be able to start the application and work with it.

Keep in mind, the build version may contain some problems we didn't fix yet.
