## Description

Vigad is a desktop application built using Electron+Vue.js. Its primary function is to extract live data from one or more specified areas on the screen. Additional configuration options allow to filter for specific (regular) expressions.

A common use case would be for example to extract the players health points from a shooter game and create a chart out of that data. Since Vigad provides a live-data-flow, it may also be possible to draw a live-map using coordinates provided on the screen.

Overall Vigad offers a wide range of use cases, even outside of gaming.

## Compatibility
Vigad has been testet on the following platforms:

- Windows 10 or newer
- Linux (coming soon)

## Requirements

- NodeJS
