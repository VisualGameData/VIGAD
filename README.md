## How to Install and Run the Project

Currently we do not have a release ready version of Vigad, but if you are interested to see what is happending you can install in locally onto you system.

First of all you need to clone our repositiory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/VisualGameData/VIGAD.git
```

Afterwards you need to install the packages.

```sh
npm i
```

Then there are two possibilities you can either start the application in developer mode via.

```sh
npm run dev
```

Or if you would like to properly install the application as a programm onto your system you can write

```sh
npm run build
```

and then execute the gerneated executable file (Windows) and you should be able to start the application and work with it.

Keep in mind the build version may contain some problems we didn't fixed yet.
